# hello-world
A place for learning

I'm currently reading "R for Data Science" by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, available digitally: http://r4ds.had.co.nz

I want to share ideas about this book on Github, so I need to learn about Github.  I'm making this edit to test what happens if I've merged another branch between the time I created and merged this branch.
